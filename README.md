# Roomie
Roomie is a platform to make cooperative living between roommates easier.

It's a webapp that facilitates shceduling, task management, rent payments, and more. 

## Project Principals
Roomie is not for profit, but for technical learning and project experience. Repos are open source, and generally APL2 licensed.

The project is delivered in 2 week sprints, following a proper agile design process. This is a spare-time project, so velocity is allowed to vary, but reasonable minimums are still expected.

## Technical Design

### Front End
The frontend of Roomie is a single page React application.

### Back End
The backend of Roomie is a distibuted micro-services model. No specific language or framework is enforced, and the objective is to either choose the best tool for each service, or the tool that will teach us the most for having built it.

No sinlge backend service should be complex enough to take more than a sprint for one engineer to rebuild from scratch.
